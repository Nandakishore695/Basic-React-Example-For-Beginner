  same versions across different machines, and it also uses checksums to verify the integrity of packages. It also has an offline mode, which allows you to install packages without an internet connection.
- In contrast, NPM is the original package manager for JavaScript, and it is still widely used. It does not have a lockfile, so the versions of packages installed on different machines may vary. It also does not 
  have an offline mode, so you must have an internet connection to install packages.
- Overall, Yarn is a more reliable and secure package manager than NPM, and it is the preferred choice for many developers.
